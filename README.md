- Initiate the deep dive analysis by clicking the relevant button.
- Wait approximately 30 seconds for the analysis to complete.

 

**Step 4: Review Investment Scorecard** [1:06](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=66)

- Examine the generated investment scorecard, which includes: 
  - Market attractiveness
  - Competitive positioning
  - Team quality
  - Financial health
  - Customer concentration
- Each category will be graded based on evidence from the CIM.

 

**Step 5: Generate Investment Thesis** [1:16](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=76)

![generated-image-at-00:01:16](https://loom.com/i/f7240c3608fd45c2b81b91fc14079bdf?workflows_screenshot=true)

- Review the investment thesis provided by DealScope.
- Understand the rationale behind the deal, key risks, and necessary beliefs for a successful return.

 

**Step 6: Analyze Financials** [1:24](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=84)

![generated-image-at-00:01:24](https://loom.com/i/c06b51adeb1e4ed2b32a26697d3c6c5f?workflows_screenshot=true)

- Review the extracted financials from the CIM.
- Adjust the valuation basis (e.g., EBITDA) and desired payment structure (e.g., earn-out).

 

**Step 7: Evaluate IRR and MOIC** [1:46](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=106)

![generated-image-at-00:01:46](https://loom.com/i/c9d15f7ec5194a41b198fb98850ec42f?workflows_screenshot=true)

- Check the populated IRR (Internal Rate of Return) on equity and MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital).
- Ensure all service requirements are met based on the financial model.

 

**Step 8: Toggle Cash Sweep Option** [2:02](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=122)

![generated-image-at-00:02:02](https://loom.com/i/79b2329667654456a0b791e7fd48cc2a?workflows_screenshot=true)

- Decide whether to enable cash sweep to pay back investors.

**Step 9: Conduct Sensitivity Analysis** [2:31](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=151)

![generated-image-at-00:02:31](https://loom.com/i/61dc6d5a5a6349dc9aa64aa84cdde7db?workflows_screenshot=true)

- Analyze the impact of cash sweep on growth requirements: 
  - Without cash sweep: 19.3% CAGR over five years.
  - With max cash sweep: 15.2% CAGR.

 

**Step 10: Compare Multiple CIMs** [3:01](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=181)

![generated-image-at-00:03:01](https://loom.com/i/1ab8abe6294d406794f47203a912b9a1?workflows_screenshot=true)

- If applicable, upload two CIMs for head-to-head comparison.
- Wait for the analysis to complete and review the direct comparison metrics and grades.

 

**Step 11: Make a Decision** [3:29](https://loom.com/share/2e545a7adb404b3e908672e0e9cb664a?t=209)

- Based on the analysis, determine which deal is stronger and why.
